# Banking Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis
* Developed Python-based machine learning models to predict bank customer churn and developed strategies to increase retention rate.
* Preprocessed dataset by data cleaning, categorical feature transformation, standardization, etc.
* Trained supervised ML models (kNN, Random Forest, XGBoost), applied regularization with optimal parameters to avoid overfitting, and utilized SMOTE for handling imbalanced data.
*	Evaluated model performance (recall, precision, AUC) via k-fold cross-validation.
